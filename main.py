    ## Project Overview
    Welcome to the GovAssist!
    The Eligibility Advisor aims to help Singaporeans easily navigate and understand their eligibility for various government assistance schemes and subsidies. 
    The GovBenefits ChatBot, on the other hand, answers Singaporeans' queries on the government schemes/benefits. This chatbot will serve as a user-friendly, conversational interface that simplifies the complex landscape of governemnt benefits by providing personalised guidance based on users' circumstances. 

    ## Objectives
    The goal of this project is to enhance accessibility, by:
    - Providing 24/7 automated assistance for users to explore government benefits
    - Reducing the need for users to manually search through multiple webpages
   
   It also aims to improve user experience by:
    - Simplifying complex eligibility criteria into conversational interactions 
    - Guiding users through a structured assessment process
    - Providing instant preliminary eligibility checks and estimated subsidy amounts
    
    At the same time, it aims to increase efficiency by reducing the workload on frontline service staffs handing enquiries as well as minimises the time users spent on researching different assistance schemes.

    ## Project Scope
    Our solution focuses on three core functionalities:
    - **Eligibility Advisor**: Allows users to check their eligibility for the respective government benefits.
    - **GovBenefits Chatbot**: Allows users to interact with the chatbot to know more about the government schemes/benefits out there.
