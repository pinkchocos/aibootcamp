If you are a self-employed person (SEP), you will get WIS once a year for work done in the previous Work Year (WY). The earliest you can get it is by end April of the following WY (e.g. by end April 2025 for work done in 2024), if the following are completed by 31 March: 
1. You have declared your income to IRAS, and CPF Board has received your assessed Net Trade Income (NTI); You have made your MediSave contributions based on your declared NTI earned in the WY without accounting for previous years’ losses; If you declare your income and make your MediSave contributions after 31 March, you will get your WIS within two months after you complete making your MediSave contributions. Hence, the earlier you declare your income and make the required MediSave contribution, the sooner you will receive your WIS. You will need to declare your income. All Net Trade Income (NTI) declarations from Work Year 2023 (Year of Assessment 2024) onwards can be made with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) by filing a tax return. There is no need to file separate declarations with CPF Board. If you receive a notification (via letter/form/SMS) to file tax from IRAS, or you meet the requirement to file tax (i.e. NTI above $6,000 and/or Total Income above $22,000), please complete and submit the tax return to IRAS directly. The income tax filing period is from 1 March to 18 April annually. If you do not receive a notification from IRAS or do not meet the requirement to file tax (i.e. NTI is less than or equal to $6,000 and/or Total Income less than or equal to $22,000), please declare your self-employed NTI to IRAS via myTax Portal so that your eligibility for WIS can be assessed. The portal will be available from 1 March to 31 October annually for taxpayers to e-File tax returns. Once IRAS has assessed your income for the year, your assessed NTI will be transmitted to the Board. You can check your updated NTI records by logging in to the Self-employment dashboard with your Singpass. For Work Year 2022 (WY2022) or earlier, If you were not issued a Notice of Assessment (NOA) by IRAS and wish to declare NTI for work years prior to 2023, you can submit an appeal via write to us using your Singpass. If you have declared your NTI with IRAS, you need not declare your income again to the Board.
2. You will need to contribute to your MediSave account. If your NTI is more than $6,000, the amount of MediSave contribution you need to make to qualify for WIS is based on your NTI earned in the Work Year without accounting for previous years' losses. CPFB receives this NTI from IRAS. This amount may differ from the MediSave contributions you are required to fulfil as a SEP under the Self-Employed Scheme (SES) which may be adjusted based on previous years' losses or excess MediSave contributions. You may refer to any of the following sources for the amount of MediSave contribution that you need to make to qualify for WIS: i) WIS e-services: Login to the WIS e-services with your Singpass to check your MediSave liability payable. ii) WIS calculator:  Estimate the amount of MediSave payable using the WIS calculator for SEPs. If your NTI is $6,000 or less, you are not required to pay MediSave contribution under SES. However, in order to qualify for WIS, you will be required to make MediSave contributions within 2 years after the year you worked. E.g. if you worked in 2024, you will need to make the Medisave contributions by 31 December 2026. Please see the following for the required amount of MediSave contribution to qualify for WIS if your NTI is $6,000 or less, according to your age in the year you worked. If you worked when you are 30 to 34 years old, you get $240. If you worked when you are 35 to 44 years old, you get $270. If you worked when you are 45 to 49 years old, you get $300. If you  worked when you are 50 years and above, you get $315. Note: SEPs earning less than $6,000 will also have to meet the eligibility criteria for concessionary WIS. Please refer to the concessionary WIS eligibility criteria here for more details. To receive the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), you must declare your income and fulfill your required MediSave contributions according to the following timelines. If you received a notification from IRAS to file tax, or meet the requirement to file tax (i.e., Net Trade Income above $6,000 and/or Total Income above $22,000), you must complete and submit your tax return directly to IRAS from 1 March to 18 April. Your MediSave contribution must be made within 30 days from the date of issuance of the notice of CPF contributions for self-employed persons from the CPF Board. Alternatively, if you are making your MediSave contributions via GIRO instalments, the deadline is 31 December two years after the Work Year. If you did not receive a notification from IRAS or do not meet the requirement to file tax, you must declare your self-employed Net Trade Income to IRAS via myTax Portal to e-File your tax returns from 1 March to 31 October. The MediSave contribution deadline in this case is 31 December two years after the Work Year, which also applies if you are making contributions via GIRO instalments.
Platform workers continue to receive the same amount of WIS as SEPs from 2025 to 2028. For the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) per year for work done from 1 January 2025, platform workers aged 30 to 34 can receive up to $1,633. Those aged 35 to 44 can receive up to $2,333, while those aged 45 to 59 can receive up to $2,800. Individuals aged 60 and above, as well as persons with disabilities, will receive up to $3,267. You can also use the online WIS calculator to estimate how much you will receive. You will receive 10% of your WIS in cash and 90% in your MediSave account. We will credit the cash portion into your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account if you have one. Otherwise, it will be credited to the bank account that you have registered to receive Government benefits, or via GovCash if you had not registered a bank account with us. If you need to update your bank account details, you can do so after logging into the e-Services. As a platform worker, you will receive WIS every month from March 2025 onwards. The table below shows when you will receive the payments. If you worked in January, you will receive the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) in your bank account or via PayNow-NRIC/Bank Crediting by the end of March, or via GovCash in the first week of April. For work done in February, payment will be made by the end of April for PayNow-NRIC/Bank Crediting, or the first week of May via GovCash. For work done in March, payment will be made by the end of May for PayNow-NRIC/Bank Crediting, or the first week of June via GovCash. In general, for work done in month x, the WIS will be credited by the end of month x+2 for PayNow-NRIC/Bank Crediting, or the first week of month x+3 via GovCash. For work done in 2024 and earlier, platform workers receive WIS as self-employed persons; more information can be found under ‘WIS for self-employed persons.’  If you are a platform worker, there’s no further action required. We will automatically assess your eligibility for WIS based on the monthly income declared by your platform operators. If your platform operator is not contributing CPF on your behalf, please approach your platform operator to clarify on the discrepancies. If your platform operator does not provide you with a satisfactory response, you can lodge a report with CPF Board.
